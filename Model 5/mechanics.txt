4 states, healthy, cancer, LTC, post cancer. The transition matrix defines the
probability of transitioning between the states. Note death is NOT part of these
states, it is treated separately. Each state has its own mortality rate.

The transition to a new period can be broken down into two parts.
1) Checking for death. There is a chance the individual dies. The mortality rates
are dependent on the OLD health state. e.g. if you are sick at 72, the chance of
living into 73 is affected by your sickness.
2) Changing health states. If the individual survives, then they are transitioned
into a new health state based on their old health state. Note that it is possible
to stay in the same health state e.g. remaining healthy.

Because of the complexity of the states, the insurance policies are priced via
simulations. The number of simulations is chosen such that the calculated prices
do not fluctuate much between simulations.

Note:Incidence rates are not used properly. This model is just illustrative though.
