This model is based off of model 2. It introduces two health related incidences (cancer, and falling into long term care).
The model allows the individual to purchase actuarially fair priced insurance policies on cancer and LTc
We also make it so cancer and entering LTC increases mortality by a fixed amount e.g. x 1.1/x 1.2
These policies pay a one off payment when the individual gets sick
Getting cancer or LTC also costs you 1 unit per period.
