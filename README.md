# LifeCycleModelling
A collection of lifecycle models written in Julia. The code is more or less complete, albeit unorganised. I am currently working on a report to complement the code between my other obligations. Once it is complete, I will look to update this readme. Contact me directly if you have any questions.

Model 1 - Consumption/Savings model  
Model 2 - Consumption/Savings/Initial Annuitisation model  
Model 4 - Consumption/Savings/Arbitrary Annuitisation model  
Model 5 - Consumption/Savings/Initial Annuitisation/Initial Cancer Insurance/Initial LTC Insurance model
